   Introducing StarQI - a platform I built to measure light pollution in India.

   Gurgaon, where I live, has severe light pollution. Most children here have
   never seen the Milky Way. I wanted to change that.

   StarQI lets anyone measure sky quality using their smartphone. Upload your
   first reading at [link]

   Let's map India's night skies together! 🌌

   #LightPollution #CitizenScience #India #Gurgaon #Environment

**Why**: First step to school partnerships

**What to do**:

2. Copy this email template:

```
Subject: Student Project - Would Love Your Input

Dear [Teacher Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am [Your Name] from Class 11 [Section].

I have been working on a project called StarQI that measures light pollution
using smartphone cameras. Since Gurgaon has severe light pollution, I thought
this might be relevant for our science curriculum.

Would you have 10 minutes this week to see a brief demo? I can meet during
lunch or after school at your convenience. I've created lesson plans and
materials that could work for a class activity.

Thank you for considering this.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Class 11 [Section]
[Your Phone]
```

3. **Hit send** (most important part!)

**Introvert-Friendly**: Email, not in-person approach. If they say yes, you can prepare!

**Your Unique Story**:
- Addressing pollution in NCR (one of world's worst)
- Indian perspective on global problem
- Bilingual content (Hindi + English)
- Serving 1.4 billion people
- Smart city relevance (Gurgaon)

**For US College Essays**:
"As a student in rapidly developing Gurgaon, India, I witnessed the environmental cost of unchecked urbanization. Rather than accepting light pollution as inevitable progress, I built technology to quantify the problem and mobilize citizens. This project bridges my love for astronomy with my belief that technology can solve local problems while creating global impact."

**That's compelling for US universities!**

## 🌟 Pep Talk

**You are doing something remarkable.**

Most Class 11 students are:
- Studying for exams ✓ (you do this too)
- Maybe doing an internship
- Maybe volunteering somewhere

You are:
- ✅ Building production-grade software
- ✅ Creating environmental impact
- ✅ Teaching yourself advanced programming
- ✅ Addressing real-world problems
- ✅ Creating value for thousands of people

**And you're doing it as an introvert**, which means:
- You work independently (valuable skill!)
- You think deeply (better solutions!)
- You communicate thoughtfully (better writing!)
- You build substantial things (not just talk!)

**This is exactly what top universities want to see.**

Your introversion is NOT holding you back. It's giving you different strengths.
