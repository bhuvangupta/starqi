## üöÄ Your Story

**The Narrative for Applications:**

*"As a high school junior passionate about astronomy and environmental
science, I noticed the increasing difficulty of stargazing in my hometown
due to light pollution. Recognizing this as both an environmental and
educational issue, I founded StarQI - a platform enabling anyone with a
smartphone to become a citizen scientist.*

*I taught myself full-stack development and built a web and mobile
application that analyzes sky photos to measure light pollution. Beyond
the technology, I focused on community impact: partnering with schools,
conducting workshops, and presenting data to local officials.*

*What started as a personal project grew into a movement, engaging
hundreds of users across multiple countries, influencing local policy,
and inspiring students to pursue environmental science. This experience
taught me that meaningful change requires not just innovation, but also
community building, persistence, and effective communication of complex
scientific concepts."*
