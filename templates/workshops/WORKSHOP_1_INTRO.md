## Sample Script

**Opening:**
"Good evening everyone, and thank you so much for coming! My name is [Your Name], and I'm a junior at [Your School]. About [X months] ago, I was frustrated that I couldn't see stars from my backyard anymore. That's when I learned about light pollution - and I was shocked. Did you know that 80% of people worldwide live under light-polluted skies? That millions of children will never see the Milky Way?

I wanted to do something about it, so I built StarQI - a platform where anyone can measure light pollution with just their smartphone. Tonight, I'm going to show you how light pollution affects you, your health, wildlife, and our planet - and most importantly, what we can do about it.

By the end of tonight, you'll have uploaded your first sky quality reading and become part of a global citizen science movement. Ready? Let's get started!"

**Good luck with your first workshop! You've got this! üåü**

Remember: The first workshop is always the hardest. It gets easier each time, and you're building an invaluable skill (public speaking) while making real impact.
