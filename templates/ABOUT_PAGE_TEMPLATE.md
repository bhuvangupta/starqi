# About StarQI

## Our Mission

StarQI is a global platform empowering citizens to measure, understand, and combat light pollution through accessible technology and data-driven advocacy.

## The Story Behind StarQI

### A Personal Connection

[Customize this section with your personal story. Example:]

"I've been fascinated by the night sky for as long as I can remember. Some of my earliest memories are of camping trips with my family, lying on my back and trying to count the stars. My [parent/grandparent] taught me to find the Big Dipper, Orion's Belt, and the North Star.

But over the years, something changed. The stars I used to see from my backyard slowly disappeared, one by one. By the time I reached high school, I could barely see a dozen stars on a clear night. The Milky Way, which I remembered from childhood camping trips, was completely invisible from my neighborhood.

I started to wonder: Where did all the stars go?"

### Discovering the Problem

[Your research and realization. Example:]

"That question led me down a path of research. I discovered that 80% of the world's population lives under light-polluted skies. I learned that more than one-third of humanity can never see the Milky Way from their homes.

But the problem went far beyond astronomy. I was shocked to learn about light pollution's impacts:

- **Wildlife**: Sea turtle hatchlings, guided by moonlight, are disoriented by artificial lights and crawl toward cities instead of the ocean. Birds migrate at the wrong times. Insects, crucial for ecosystems, are decimated by light attraction.

- **Human Health**: Excessive nighttime light disrupts our circadian rhythms, affecting sleep and contributing to serious health issues like obesity, depression, and diabetes.

- **Energy Waste**: Approximately 30% of outdoor lighting in the United States is wasted, costing $3.3 billion annually and generating 21 million tons of carbon dioxide.

- **Cultural Loss**: Countless children will grow up never seeing the Milky Way, never experiencing the awe that inspired millennia of human art, science, and philosophy.

This wasn't just about losing stars—it was an environmental crisis hiding in plain sight."

### From Frustration to Action

[Your decision to build StarQI. Example:]

"I was frustrated. Here was a significant environmental problem that most people didn't even know about. The solutions existed—better lighting design, dark-sky ordinances, community awareness—but we lacked data to show the scope of the problem and mobilize action.

That's when I had an idea: What if anyone could measure light pollution, just like people measure air quality? What if we could build a global database of sky quality that citizens could use for advocacy?

As a student passionate about both coding and environmental science, I realized I could build this. I had learned web development through online courses, but I'd never built anything at this scale. I didn't know if I could do it, but I knew I had to try.

I spent [X months] teaching myself advanced TypeScript, React, Node.js, Flutter, and image processing algorithms. I read research papers on sky quality measurement. I tested different approaches to star detection. I failed. A lot. But each failure taught me something new.

Finally, after [X hours] of coding, debugging, and testing, StarQI was born."

### What StarQI Does

StarQI makes light pollution measurement accessible to everyone:

**Measure**: Upload a photo of the night sky from your smartphone. Our advanced algorithms analyze brightness, star count, color temperature, and other metrics to generate a comprehensive sky quality report.

**Visualize**: See your reading on our interactive global map. Compare your location to others. Track changes over time. Identify dark sky treasures and areas needing intervention.

**Learn**: Access educational resources about light pollution's impacts and solutions. Understand what your measurements mean. Discover how you can make a difference.

**Act**: Use our advocacy tools to generate reports for local officials. Share your findings. Join community campaigns. Be part of the solution.

### The Impact So Far

[Fill in with your actual numbers:]

Since launching in [Month Year], StarQI has:
- Engaged **[X] users** across **[X] countries**
- Collected **[X] sky quality measurements**
- Partnered with **[X] schools**, reaching **[X] students**
- Conducted **[X] educational workshops** with **[X] attendees**
- [Any other achievements: media coverage, awards, partnerships, etc.]

[Optional - specific impact stories:]
"One of the most rewarding moments was when [specific story—e.g., 'a teacher from Texas contacted me to say her students used StarQI data to present to their city council, resulting in a lighting ordinance review']. That's when I realized this project was bigger than me—it was becoming a movement."

### Looking Forward

This is just the beginning. Our goals for the next year include:
- Expanding our school partnership program to [X] schools
- Presenting light pollution data to local government to influence policy
- Building a community of [X] active citizen scientists
- Launching mobile apps for iOS and Android
- Integrating with Sky Quality Meter devices for even more precise data
- Partnering with research institutions to support environmental science

Most importantly, I want to inspire other young people to use technology and science to solve real problems in their communities. You don't need to wait until you're older to make a difference. You don't need permission to start. You just need an idea, determination, and the willingness to learn.

### Join the Movement

Whether you're an amateur astronomer, an environmental advocate, an educator, a researcher, or simply someone who misses seeing stars—you have a place in this community.

Upload your first reading. Share your data. Spread awareness. Together, we can restore our night skies.
