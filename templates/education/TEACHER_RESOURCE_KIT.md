## Success Stories

[As you get schools to participate, add their stories here:]

**Example:**
"My 7th grade science class used StarQI to map light pollution in our town. Students were shocked to discover that the new shopping center increased local light pollution by 40%. They presented their findings to the city council, which agreed to review the lighting plan. I've never seen students so engaged!" - *Ms. Johnson, Pine Valley Middle School*
