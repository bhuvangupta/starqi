LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT LAUNCHES PLATFORM TO FIGHT LIGHT POLLUTION

[Your City], [State] - [Date] - [Your Name], a junior at [Your High School],
has launched StarQI (Star Quality Index), a free web and mobile platform that
enables anyone to measure and map light pollution using their smartphone camera.

The innovative platform addresses a growing environmental concern: 80% of the
world's population lives under light-polluted skies, according to the
International Dark-Sky Association. Light pollution not only obscures our view
of the cosmos but also disrupts wildlife, wastes energy, and impacts human
health.

"I've always been passionate about astronomy, but I noticed fewer and fewer
stars visible from my backyard each year," said [Your Name], age [XX]. "I
wanted to create a tool that would help people understand light pollution in
their area and take action to reduce it."

StarQI uses advanced image analysis algorithms to evaluate night sky photos,
providing users with:
• Sky Quality Meter (SQM) readings
• Bortle Scale classifications
• Interactive global maps showing light pollution levels
• Educational resources about light pollution impacts
• Tools for environmental advocacy

The platform has already attracted [X] users across [X] cities and collected
[X] sky quality measurements. [Your Name] plans to partner with local schools
to integrate citizen science into science curricula and is organizing community
workshops to raise awareness.

"This project combines my interests in computer science, environmental science,
and community engagement," [Your Name] added. "I hope StarQI will inspire
others to look up, notice the problem, and become advocates for dark skies."

The platform is available at [your-website] and is free to use for individuals,
schools, and researchers.

For more information, visit [website] or contact [email].
